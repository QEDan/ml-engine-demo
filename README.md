# ml-engine-demo
A small demo of how to use the Machine Learning Engine on Google Cloud Platform.
This repo accompanies a presentation done for the Vancouver Machine Learning in Production Meetup group.

## Talk Abstract
Machine Learning Engine is a product on Google Cloud Platform that allows for highly managed
training and deployment of Tensorflow models. Starting from a Tensorflow code that runs
locally, I will show how to submit a distributed training job to the cloud, how to store the trained model
to a GCP storage bucket, and how to use the hyperparameter optimization features.
Finally, I will deploy the model to production. All this in front of a live audience!
I will also go through the pros and cons of using ML-Engine and discuss how to use it with
Keras+tensorflow models.
